#real_data_2.xlsx is the data after preprocessing.
#FDCMs_Modified-FDCMs_Static_real_data_forplot.R outputs out_array_B_new.RData which is used to draw figure in Section 5.1 and Appendix F.
#U_change_with_time.R draws the Figure 1 in Section 5.1.
#Plot.R reads out_array_B_new.RData produced by FDCMs_Modified-FDCMs_Static_real_data_forplot.R and draws the Figure 2 in Section 5.1 and Figure 3 in Appendix F.
#FDCMs_Modified-FDCMs_Static_real_data.R computes AVR, STD, IR for FDCMs, Modified-FDCMs and Static method.
#Kernel_Modified-Kernel_real_data.R computes AVR, STD, IR for Kernel and Modified-Kernel.
